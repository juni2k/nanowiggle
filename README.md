# Nanowiggle

This is a tiny Windows application for wiggling your mouse.

It does not do anything else.

## Background

I saw someone without admin rights use a mouse wiggler to keep their
computer from locking the screen. However, that application depended on
.NET, resulting in a self-contained binary with dozens of megabytes in
size.

In order to make a point, I made Nanowiggle. It's less than 30 KB in
size and runs on every Windows version of the last 20 years.

## Tested on:

- Windows 2000
- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Wine (only functional on X11)
